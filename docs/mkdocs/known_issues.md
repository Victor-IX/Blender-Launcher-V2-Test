# Known Issues

## Linux Distribution Compatibility

This program may not work properly on all Linux distributions due to limitations with PyInstaller. We provide two different Linux versions, one for Ubuntu and the other for Archlinux. If you use another Linux distribution, it's possible that the Blender Launcher may not work.

## Workaround

If you want to use the Blender Launcher on a different Linux distribution that does not work with the provided version, you can build the program on your machine directly. This will create a custom build compatible with your OS.

## Important Notes

!!! warning "Library Folder"

    It is recommended to create a new folder on a non system drive or inside user folder like `Documents` to avoid any file collisions and have a nice structure.

!!! warning "Windows Users"

    Don't use UAC protected folders like `Program Files` and don't run **Blender Launcher** with administration rights. It may cause unexpected behavior for program itself as well as Blender 3D.

!!! info "Linux Users"

    - Make sure that OS GLIBC version is 2.27 or higher otherwise try to build **Blender Launcher** from source manually following [Development](development.md) documentation page.
    - Consider installing [TopIcons Plus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/) extension for proper tray icon support.

!!! info "Blender Version Manager Users"

    Since **Blender Launcher** is written from scratch with a different concept in mind it is strongly recommended not to use a **Root Folder** as **Library Folder**. Otherwise delete all builds from **Root Folder** or move them to `%Library Folder%\daily` directory.

# Feature Request

## How to request a feature

Blender Launcher is relatively new project, so it is always nice to hear feedback and requests from Blender community about how to improve user experience. The best place to discuss proposals is a Blender Artists Community [thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/blender-launcher-standalone-software-client) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/3jrTZFJkTd), however an issue template for [feature request](https://github.com/Victor-IX/Blender-Launcher-V2/issues/new?assignees=Victor-IX&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) is also available.
